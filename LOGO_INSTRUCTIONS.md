# Logo Implementation Instructions

## Current Setup

I've implemented the logo display in all the required locations:
1. Home page (above the college name)
2. Authentication forms (login, register, admin login)
3. Dashboard headers (admin and student)
4. Browser tab (favicon and title)

## How to Add Your Custom College Logo

### Step 1: Prepare Your Logo
1. Create a logo image file (PNG or JPG format recommended)
2. Recommended sizes:
   - Favicon: 32x32 pixels
   - Header logo: 192x192 pixels
   - Form logo: 80x80 pixels

### Step 2: Replace the Existing Logo Files
Replace the following files in the `client/public` directory with your custom logo:
1. `favicon.ico` - For browser tab icon
2. `logo192.png` - For header logos and form logos
3. `logo512.png` - For high-resolution displays (optional)

### Step 3: Alternative Method (Adding a New Logo File)
If you prefer to keep the existing files and add a new logo:

1. Add your logo file to the `client/public` directory (e.g., `college-logo.png`)

2. Update the image sources in the following files:
   - `client/src/components/Home.js` - Line with `<img src="/logo192.png"...`
   - `client/src/components/auth/Login.js` - Line with `<img src="/logo192.png"...`
   - `client/src/components/auth/Register.js` - Line with `<img src="/logo192.png"...`
   - `client/src/components/auth/AdminLogin.js` - Line with `<img src="/logo192.png"...`
   - `client/src/components/admin/AdminHeader.js` - Line with `<img src="/logo192.png"...`
   - `client/src/components/student/StudentHeader.js` - Line with `<img src="/logo192.png"...`

3. Update the favicon in `client/public/index.html`:
   - Change `<link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />` to point to your favicon

### Logo Placement Details

1. **Home Page**: Logo appears above the college name in the hero section
2. **Authentication Forms**: Logo appears at the top of each form, above the college name
3. **Admin Dashboard Header**: Small logo appears to the left of "Gapsight College Admin"
4. **Student Dashboard Header**: Small logo appears to the left of "Gapsight College Voting"
5. **Browser Tab**: Logo appears as favicon, and the title shows "Gapsight College Voting System"

## CSS Classes for Logo Styling

- `.school-logo` - Large logo on home page (100x100px)
- `.college-logo` - Medium logo on forms (80x80px)
- `.header-logo` - Small logo in headers (30x30px)

## Troubleshooting

If your logo doesn't appear:
1. Make sure the file names match exactly
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Restart the development server
4. Check the browser console for any 404 errors related to image loading

The system is now fully configured to display your college logo in all the requested locations.
