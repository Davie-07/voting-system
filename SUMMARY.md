## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js** with **Express.js** framework
- **MongoDB Atlas** for database storage
- **JWT** for authentication
- **bcryptjs** for password hashing
- **Multer** for file uploads

### Frontend
- **React.js** for user interface
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Axios** for API communication
- **Font Awesome** for icons

## System Architecture

The system follows a client-server architecture with a RESTful API design:

```
[Student UI] ──┐
               ├── [React Frontend] ── [Express Backend] ── [MongoDB Atlas]
[Admin UI]   ──┘
```

## Database Schema

The system uses five main collections:
1. **Users** - Student information
2. **Admins** - Administrator credentials
3. **Contestants** - Candidate data
4. **VotingSessions** - Voting session status and schedule
5. **Votes** - Individual vote records

## Deployment

The application is designed to be deployed with:
- Backend server running on Node.js
- MongoDB Atlas for cloud database
- Frontend built as static files for production
- Environment-based configuration

## How to Use

### For Administrators
1. Login using Admin System ID and Password
2. Add contestants through the Contestant Management section

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Email notifications for voting schedules
