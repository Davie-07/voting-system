# API Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **404 API Endpoint Errors**: Multiple API endpoints were returning 404 errors:
   - `/api/student/voting/session`
   - `/api/student/contestants`
   - `/api/student/voting/positions`
   - `/api/admin/voting/session`

2. **Missing Resources**: 
   - `favicon.ico` 
   - Browser autocomplete warnings for password fields

3. **CORS Configuration**: Potential CORS issues between frontend and backend

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed .env Configuration
- Corrected formatting issues in the .env file
- Ensured proper JWT_SECRET and MONGODB_URI configuration

### 2. Updated API Configuration (`client/src/utils/api.js`)
- Fixed baseURL to properly handle development and production environments:
  - Development: `http://localhost:5000/api`
  - Production: `/api`
- Maintained token interceptor for authentication

### 3. Fixed Favicon and Logo Issues (`client/public/index.html`)
- Updated favicon reference to use `ktvc-logo-r.png` instead of `favicon.ico`
- Updated apple-touch-icon reference to use `ktvc-logo-r.png`

### 4. Added Autocomplete Attributes
- Added `autoComplete="username"` to admission number and system ID fields
- Added `autoComplete="current-password"` to password fields
- Fixed browser warnings about missing autocomplete attributes

### 5. Improved CORS Configuration (`server.js`)
- Added proper CORS configuration with origin settings
- Set credentials to true for better cross-origin handling
- Configured different settings for development and production environments

## Technical Details

### API Endpoint Resolution
The original issue was caused by a mismatch between:
1. Client API calls using paths like `/student/voting/session`
2. Server routes defined with `/api/student/voting/session`
3. API baseURL configuration

The fix involved:
- Setting the baseURL to include `/api` prefix
- Keeping client calls with clean paths (without `/api` prefix)
- This ensures the final request URL is correctly formed as `/api/student/voting/session`

### CORS Configuration
Added explicit CORS configuration to handle:
- Development environment: Allow requests from `http://localhost:3000`
- Production environment: Allow requests from the same origin (false)

### Resource Handling
- Updated favicon to use existing college logo
- Added proper autocomplete attributes to resolve browser warnings

## Testing
All fixes have been implemented and tested to ensure:
- API endpoints now resolve correctly
- No more 404 errors for valid endpoints
- Resources load properly
- Browser warnings are resolved
- CORS issues are handled appropriately

## Additional Recommendations

1. **MongoDB Connection**: Ensure the MongoDB URI in .env is correct and the database is accessible
2. **JWT Secret**: Keep the JWT_SECRET secure and do not share it
3. **Environment Variables**: Consider using different .env files for different environments (.env.development, .env.production)
4. **Error Handling**: Consider adding more detailed error logging for API failures
5. **Security**: Ensure proper authentication and authorization for all API endpoints

These fixes should resolve the 404 errors and improve the overall stability of the voting system.
