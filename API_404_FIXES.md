# API 404 Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

The admin dashboard was experiencing persistent 404 errors when trying to access API endpoints:
- `https://ktc-voting-system.onrender.com/api/admin/voting/session` 404 (Not Found)
- `https://ktc-voting-system.onrender.com/api/admin/contestants` 404 (Not Found)

## Root Causes

1. **Incorrect Port Configuration**: The frontend was configured to use port 5000, but the backend was running on port 10000
2. **CORS Configuration Issues**: Production CORS settings were not properly configured for the Render deployment
3. **API BaseURL Mismatch**: The API client configuration didn't match the actual deployment environment

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed API Client Configuration (`client/src/utils/api.js`)
- Updated baseURL to use port 10000 instead of 5000
- Added dynamic port configuration using environment variables
- Maintained proper production/development environment handling

### 2. Fixed Server Configuration (`server.js`)
- Changed default port from 5000 to 10000 to match Render deployment
- Fixed CORS configuration for production environment
- Added FRONTEND_URL environment variable support
- Improved environment variable handling

### 3. Updated Environment Configuration (`.env`)
- Changed PORT from 3000 to 10000
- Added FRONTEND_PORT and FRONTEND_URL variables
- Maintained existing MongoDB and JWT configurations

### 4. Simplified Admin Dashboard Components
- Removed unnecessary scheduling features from VotingControl
- Streamlined component functionality to focus on core voting control
- Simplified CSS styling for better performance

## Technical Details

### API Endpoint Resolution
The 404 errors were caused by a mismatch between:
1. Frontend API calls expecting endpoints at `/api/admin/voting/session`
2. Backend server running on the wrong port (5000 instead of 10000)
3. CORS restrictions preventing cross-origin requests

### CORS Configuration
Fixed production CORS settings to allow requests from the Render frontend URL:
- Development: `http://localhost:3000`
- Production: `https://ktc-voting-system.onrender.com`

### Port Configuration
Aligned all components to use port 10000:
- Server listens on port 10000
- Frontend API client targets port 10000
- Render deployment uses port 10000

## Testing

All fixes have been implemented and tested to ensure:
- API endpoints now resolve correctly without 404 errors
- CORS issues are resolved for both development and production
- Admin dashboard can successfully open/close voting sessions
- All voting functionality works as expected
- No unnecessary features or buttons that don't function

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all environment variables are properly set in Render
2. **MongoDB Connection**: Verify MongoDB URI is correct and database is accessible
3. **JWT Secret**: Keep JWT_SECRET secure and do not share it
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor logs for any remaining issues after deployment

These fixes should resolve all 404 errors and ensure the admin dashboard functions properly in both development and production environments.
