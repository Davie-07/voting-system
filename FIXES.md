# Fixes for Voting System Issues

## Issue 1: Admin "Open Voting" Not Updating Student Dashboard

The problem is that when the admin clicks "Open Voting", the student dashboard doesn't immediately reflect the change. This is because the student dashboard relies on polling to check for updates, but the polling interval was too long.

## Issue 2: Failed to Load Data Errors

The "Failed to load contestants data" and "Failed to load voting positions" errors occur when the frontend cannot connect to the backend API endpoints. This could be due to:

1. Backend not running
2. CORS issues
3. Authentication problems
4. Network connectivity issues
5. MongoDB connection issues

## Issue 3: Contestant Management Errors

The admin dashboard shows "Contestant added successfully! Failed to load contestants" after adding a contestant. This is due to inadequate error handling in the contestant management component.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Improved Session Polling in Student Dashboard

Reduced polling interval from 5 seconds to 2 seconds in both StudentDashboard.js and VotingPositions.js for more responsive updates when the admin opens/closes voting.

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

Improved error handling in VotingPositions.js to provide more specific error messages and better recovery mechanisms.

### 3. Fixed Contestant Management Issues

Improved error handling in ContestantManagement.js to provide clearer feedback to users.
